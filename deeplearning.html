        <h2>What is Deep Learning?</h2>
        <p>Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the 
        brain called artificial neural networks.</p>
        <p>Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. 
        Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian 
        from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning
        is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. Itâ€™s achieving results that were not possible before.</p>
