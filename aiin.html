        <h2>AI in Education</h2>
        <p>AI can assist students and adapt to their needs, helping them work at their own pace. AI tutors can provide
        additional support to students, ensuring they stay on track. AI could change where and how students learn, perhaps 
        even replacing some teachers.</p>
        <h2>AI in Manufacturing</h2>
        <p>This is an area that has been at the forefront of incorporating robots into the workflow. Industrial 
        robots used to perform single tasks and were separated from human workers, but as the technology advanced 
        that changed.</p>
