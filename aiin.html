        <h2>AI in Education</h2>
        <p>AI can automate grading, giving educators more time. AI can assess students and adapt to their needs, 
        helping them work at their own pace. AI tutors can provide additional support to students, ensuring they 
        stay on track. AI could change where and how students learn, perhaps even replacing some teachers.</p>
        <h2>AI in Manufacturing</h2>
        <p>This is an area that has been at the forefront of incorporating robots into the workflow. Industrial 
        robots used to perform single tasks and were separated from human workers, but as the technology advanced 
        that changed.</p>
